*** TODO compact layout
*** TODO reliable and smooth http GET
- move fetching away from http GET to heroku scheduler.
- cache in redis to persist cache across deployments/restarts
*** TODO feature: hide links
and/or style them the same as 'visited' links
*** TODO consider fetching from client side (Elm)
no Go server required.
- assuming reddit and HN api have the perms
- use local storage to cache values
- blog post worthy topic (transition from Go server to SPA elm and local storage)
